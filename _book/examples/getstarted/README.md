# GettingStarted

👏 Well, this part is to get you know some basic knowledge and operations. 

Four simple projects with just several lines of code will guide you into the SwiftIO world. 

* [Blink](blink.md) - output 3.3 volts and 0 volt on a digital pin alternatively to blink the onboard led.
* [PWMBrightnessControl](pwmbrightnesscontrol.md) - brighten and dim the led continuously by increasing and decreasing the duty cycle of the PWM output.
* [ReadDigitalInput](readdigitalinput.md) - read and print the input value of digital pin D0, either true or false.
* [ReadAnalogInput](readanaloginput.md) - read and print the input voltage of analog pin A0. The value is a float number between 0.0 and 3.3.
