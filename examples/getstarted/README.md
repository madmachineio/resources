# GettingStarted

Well, in this part, you will get to know some basic concepts about SwiftIO with simple projects - like digital and analog signals. They are quite simple but are widely used.

Four simple projects with just several lines of code will guide you into the SwiftIO world. 

* [Blink](blink.md) - output 3.3 volts and 0 volts on a digital pin alternatively to blink the onboard LED.
* [ReadDigitalInput](readdigitalinput.md) - read and print the input value of a digital pin, either true or false.
* [ReadAnalogInput](readanaloginput.md) - read and print the input voltage of an analog pin. The value is a float number between 0.0 and 3.3.
* [PWMBrightnessControl](pwmbrightnesscontrol.md) - brighten and dim the led continuously by increasing and decreasing the duty cycle of the PWM output.
