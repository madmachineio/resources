## \*\*\*\*🔸 **Step 3: Prepare SD card and confirm USB connection**

Make sure that you have inserted a SD card into the slot. 

Connect your SwiftIO board to your computer through the Download port using a Micro-USB cable. 

SwiftIO will simulate the device as a USB Flash Drive on your computer. 

The RGB LED will show you the current status of the USB communication: 

* Red: error
* Green: USB connection
* Blue: SD card detection

## \*\*\*\*🔸 **Step 4: Build your code and download it to board**

Press the Download button to mount the device into your computer. 

An icon will appear in the status bar of  the IDE.

 __📌 _**Please note** any bad quality USB cable or some third-party USB hub will lead to connection failure._

Click the Download icon.
