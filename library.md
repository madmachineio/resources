# Library Reference

## [SwiftIO](https://swiftioapi.madmachine.io)

The SwiftIO library provides easy access to communicate with the external circuits simply by invoking the related classes/methods in the MadMachine IDE. You can read or write the digital and analog signals, as well as using the communication protocol.

## [MadBoards](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadBoards)

The MadBoards library consists of the id of each board. There are two available: **SwiftIOBoard** and **SwiftIOFeather**. When you write the code, you need to import the right one to use the pin id.

## [MadDrivers](https://github.com/madmachineio/MadDrivers)

The MadDrivers library contains the drivers of different devices. Each type of device has its own way of configuration. We have created some for you, like the humiture sensor, the LCD, etc. You just import the one you need in your code and then could use the methods to communicate with it.
