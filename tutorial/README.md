# Tutorial

Congratulations! üëè You must have finished your first simple project.

Now it's time to know more about the whole ecosystem. Let's have a rough knowledge of the project structure:

‚ë† **Hardware**

**SwiftIO board** is our first board that could run Swift language. It is powerful enough for your projects. You could use it to light a LED, read a sensor, play music, etc. And we believe it has huge potential in GUI programming. There's a long way to go.

‚ë° **Software**

**MadMachine IDE** is the integrated development environment for the project. Its usage is as simple as possible, in order to provide you guys with an easy start. It allows you to write, compile and download code. Now, you could use it on Windows or macOS.

If you would like to stick to your familiar editor, there is a command-line tool for you: **mm-sdk**. You could edit the code wherever you like, then compile the code with this tool. 

**‚ë¢ Framework**

SwiftIO framework is what you need in every project. You could easily control the SwiftIO board with the API provided in it, and don't need to care about complicated low-level hardware knowledge.

Ok, after a basic understanding of our project, it's time to dive deeper into details:

* [What is SwiftIO](what-is-swiftio.md)
* [How to use IDE](how-to-use-ide.md)
* [How to use MM SDK](how-to-use-mm-sdk.md)
* [How to use a Library](about-library.md)
