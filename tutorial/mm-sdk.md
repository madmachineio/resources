# MM SDK

## MM SDK

The mm-sdk contains everything you need to build a MadMachine project, either a library or an executable.

A MadMachine project is structured like a [SPM package](https://swift.org/package-manager). A Python script is used to build the project now and it would be replaced by Swift Package Manager in the future.

The latest features would be added to this SDK first and then integrated into the MadMachine IDE.

[Download](https://github.com/madmachineio/mm-sdk) the latest release depending on your operating system.

## What is inside the SDK

1. tools\_linux/tools\_mac/tools\_win:
   * Swift compiler and standard library for ARM-Cortex M7
   * ARM-GCC compiler and binutils
   * Compiled Python scripts
2. scripts:
   * Python scripts which used to build the project
3. hal:
   * Board abstraction library based on [Zephyr](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr)
4. Examples & Library:
   * Latest examples and libraries

## Usage \(Take macOS for example\)

Download and unzip the sdk to the directory `~`

Run `~/mm-sdk/tools_mac/scripts/dist/mm/mm -h` command for quick help.

Run `~/mm-sdk/tools_mac/scripts/dist/mm/mm init -h` command for quick help about initializing a project.

Run `~/mm-sdk/tools_mac/scripts/dist/mm/mm build -h` command for quick help about building a project.

### Initialize a library `DemoLibrary`

```text
cd ~/mm-sdk/Library
mkdir DemoLibrary
cd DemoLibrary
~/mm-sdk/tools_mac/scripts/dist/mm/mm init -t lib
```

### Initialize an executable `DemoProgram`

```text
cd ~
mkdir DemoProgram
cd DemoProgram
~/mm-sdk/tools_mac/scripts/dist/mm/mm init
```

### Add the `DemoLibrary` as a dependency to `DemoProgram`

1. Open the `DemoProgram.mmp` by any text editor
2. Add `"DemoLibrary"` in the `dependecies`
3. Save and quit
4. Then you can `import DemoLibrary` in project `DemoProgram`

### Build a library

```text
cd ~/mm-sdk/Library/DemoLibrary
~/mm-sdk/tools_mac/scripts/dist/mm/mm build --sdk ~/mm-sdk --module ~/mm-sdk/Library
```

### Build an executable

When building a project \(either library or executable\), the Python script would try to find the dependent libraries in the specified directory.

If the dependent library is not builded yet, the Python script would build the library first. Use `--rebuild` to force rebuild all dependent libraries.

```text
cd ~/DemoProgram
~/mm-sdk/tools_mac/scripts/dist/mm/mm build --sdk ~/mm-sdk --module ~/mm-sdk/Library
```

### Download an executable

After a successful building, there would be `.build/swiftio.bin` in your project directory. Note that the `.build` directory is hidden by default.

Follow those steps to download the executable:

1. Insert SD card and confirm USB connection \(Press the **Download** button and wait the onboard RGB turns to **green**\)
2. A USB drive would be mounted on your computer
3. Copy the `swiftio.bin` to the SD card root directory
4. Eject the USB drive and the program would run automatically

## Usage \(Take Windows10 for example\)

Download and unzip the sdk to the directory `D:\`

Press the `Win + R` keys on your keyboard, then type `cmd`, and press Enter on your keyboard or click OK to run a Command Prompt.

Run `D:\mm-sdk\tools_win\scripts\dist\mm\mm.exe -h` command for quick help.

Run `D:\mm-sdk\tools_win\scripts\dist\mm\mm.exe init -h` command for quick help about initializing a project.

Run `D:\mm-sdk\tools_win\scripts\dist\mm\mm.exe build -h` command for quick help about building a project.

### Initialize a library `DemoLibrary`

```text
D:
cd mm-sdk\Library
mkdir DemoLibrary
cd DemoLibrary
D:\mm-sdk\tools_win\scripts\dist\mm\mm.exe init -t lib
```

### Initialize an executable `DemoProgram`

```text
D:
mkdir DemoProgram
cd DemoProgram
D:\mm-sdk\tools_win\scripts\dist\mm\mm.exe init
```

### Add the `DemoLibrary` as a dependency to `DemoProgram`

1. Open the `DemoProgram.mmp` by any text editor
2. Add `"DemoLibrary"` in the `dependecies`
3. Save and quit
4. Then you can `import DemoLibrary` in project `DemoProgram`

### Build a library

```text
D:
cd mm-sdk\Library\DemoLibrary
D:\mm-sdk\tools_win\scripts\dist\mm\mm.exe build --sdk D:\mm-sdk --module D:\mm-sdk\Library
```

### Build an executable

When building a project \(either library or executable\), the Python script would try to find the dependent libraries in the specified directory.

If the dependent library is not builded yet, the Python script would build the library first. Use `--rebuild` to force rebuild all dependent libraries.

```text
D:
cd DemoProgram
D:\mm-sdk\tools_win\scripts\dist\mm\mm.exe build --sdk D:\mm-sdk --module D:\mm-sdk\Library
```

### Download an executable

After a successful building, there would be `.build/swiftio.bin` in your project directory.

Follow those steps to download the executable:

1. Insert SD card and confirm USB connection \(Press the **Download** button and wait the onboard RGB turns to **green**\)
2. A USB drive would be mounted on your computer
3. Copy the `swiftio.bin` to the SD card root directory
